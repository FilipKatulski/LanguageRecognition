Toponymy
of
England
The
name
England
is
derived
from
the
Old
English
name
Englaland
which
means
land
of
the
Angles
The
Angles
were
one
of
the
Germanic
tribes
that
settled
in
Great
Britain
during
the
Early
Middle
Ages
The
Angles
came
from
the
Anglia
peninsula
in
the
Bay
of
Kiel
area
present
day
German
state
of
Schleswig–Holstein
of
the
Baltic
Sea
The
earliest
recorded
use
of
the
term
as
Engla
londe
is
in
the
late
ninth
century
translation
into
Old
English
of
Bede
's
Ecclesiastical
History
of
the
English
People
The
term
was
then
used
in
a
different
sense
to
the
modern
one
meaning
the
land
inhabited
by
the
English
and
it
included
English
people
in
what
is
now
south
east
Scotland
but
was
then
part
of
the
English
kingdom
of
Northumbria
The
Anglo
Saxon
Chronicle
recorded
that
the
Domesday
Book
of
covered
the
whole
of
England
meaning
the
English
kingdom
but
a
few
years
later
the
Chronicle
stated
that
King
Malcolm
III
went
out
of
Scotlande
into
Lothian
in
Englaland
thus
using
it
in
the
more
ancient
sense
According
to
the
Oxford
English
Dictionary
its
modern
spelling
was
first
used
in
The
earliest
attested
reference
to
the
Angles
occurs
in
the
st
century
work
by
Tacitus
Germania
in
which
the
Latin
word
Anglii
is
used
The
etymology
of
the
tribal
name
itself
is
disputed
by
scholars
it
has
been
suggested
that
it
derives
from
the
shape
of
the
Angeln
peninsula
an
angular
shape
How
and
why
a
term
derived
from
the
name
of
a
tribe
that
was
less
significant
than
others
such
as
the
Saxons
came
to
be
used
for
the
entire
country
and
its
people
is
not
known
but
it
seems
this
is
related
to
the
custom
of
calling
the
Germanic
people
in
Britain
Angli
Saxones
or
English
Saxons
to
distinguish
them
from
continental
Saxons
Eald
Seaxe
of
Old
Saxony
between
the
Weser
and
Eider
rivers
in
Northern
Germany
In
Scottish
Gaelic
another
language
which
developed
on
the
island
of
Great
Britain
the
Saxon
tribe
gave
their
name
to
the
word
for
England
Sasunn
similarly
the
Welsh
name
for
the
English
language
is
Saesneg
An
alternative
name
for
England
is
Albion
The
name
Albion
originally
referred
to
the
entire
island
of
Great
Britain
The
nominally
earliest
record
of
the
name
appears
in
the
Aristotelian
Corpus
specifically
the
th
century
BC
De
Mundo
Beyond
the
Pillars
of
Hercules
is
the
ocean
that
flows
round
the
earth
In
it
are
two
very
large
islands
called
Britannia
these
are
Albion
and
Ierne
But
modern
scholarly
consensus
ascribes
De
Mundo
not
to
Aristotle
but
to
Pseudo
Aristotle
ie
it
was
written
later
in
the
Graeco
Roman
period
or
afterwards
The
word
Albion
Ἀλβίων
or
insula
Albionum
has
two
possible
origins
It
either
derives
from
a
cognate
of
the
Latin
albus
meaning
white
a
reference
to
the
white
cliffs
of
Dover
the
only
part
of
Britain
visible
from
the
European
mainland
or
from
the
phrase
the
island
of
the
Albiones
in
the
now
lost
Massaliote
Periplus
that
is
attested
through
Avienus
'
Ora
Maritima
to
which
the
former
presumably
served
as
a
source
Albion
is
now
applied
to
England
in
a
more
poetic
capacity
Another
romantic
name
for
England
is
Loegria
related
to
the
Welsh
word
for
England
Lloegr
and
made
popular
by
its
use

The

are

to
have

genetic

suggests
they
came
from

The
sea
level
was
lower

was

to

As

around
BC
introducing

food
vessels
constructed
from

as

as

used
as

to

It
was
during

that

Avebury
were
constructed
By

which
were

in

the

people
made

The
development
of

allowed
the
construction
of

advancing

as

as

had
long
enjoyed

with

of

attempted
to
invade
twice
in
BC
although
largely
unsuccessful
he
managed
to
set
up
a

from
the

The
Romans
invaded
Britain
in
AD
during
the
reign
of
Emperor
Claudius
subsequently
conquering
much
of
Britain
and
the
area
was
incorporated
into
the
Roman
Empire
as
Britannia
province
The
best
known
of
the
native
tribes
who
attempted
to
resist
were
the
Catuvellauni
led
by
Caratacus

an
uprising
led
by
Boudica
Queen
of
the
Iceni
ended
with
Boudica's
suicide
following
her
defeat
at
the
Battle
of

of
one
study
of

suggested

There
is
debate
about
when
Christianity
was
first
introduced
it
was
no
later
than
the
th
century
probably
much
earlier
According
to
Bede
missionaries
were
sent
from
Rome
by
Eleutherius
at
the
request
of
the
chieftain
Lucius
of
Britain
in
AD
to
settle
differences
as
to
Eastern
and
Western
ceremonials
which
were
disturbing

are
traditions

By

During
the
settlement
period
the
lands
ruled
by
the
incomers
seem
to
have
been
fragmented
into
numerous
tribal
territories
but
by
the
th
century
when
substantial
evidence
of
the
situation
again
becomes
available
these
had
coalesced
into
roughly
a
dozen
kingdoms
including
Northumbria
Mercia
Wessex
East
Anglia
Essex
Kent
and
Sussex
Over
the
following
centuries
this
process
of
political
consolidation
continued
The
th
century
saw
a
struggle
for
hegemony
between
Northumbria
and
Mercia
which
in
the
th
century
gave
way
to
Mercian
preeminence
In
the
early
th
century
Mercia
was
displaced
as
the
foremost
kingdom
by
Wessex
Later
in
that
century
escalating
attacks
by
the
Danes
culminated
in
the
conquest
of
the
north
and
east
of
England
overthrowing
the
kingdoms
of
Northumbria
Mercia
and
East
Anglia
Wessex
under
Alfred
the
Great
was
left
as
the
only
surviving
English
kingdom
and
under
his
successors
it
steadily
expanded
at
the
expense
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
Danelaw
This
brought
about
the
political
unification
of
England
first
accomplished
under
Æthelstan
in
and
definitively
established
after
further
conflicts
by
Eadred
in
A
fresh
wave
of
Scandinavian
attacks
from
the
late
th
century
ended
with
the
conquest
of
this
united
kingdom
by
Sweyn
Forkbeard
in
and
again
by
his
son
Cnut
in
turning
it
into
the
centre
of
a
short
lived
North
Sea
Empire
that
also
included
Denmark
and
Norway
However
the
native
royal
dynasty
was
restored
with
the
accession
of
Edward
the
Confessor
in
King
Henry
V
at
the
Battle
of
Agincourt
fought
on
Saint
Crispin's
Day
and
concluded
with
an
English
victory
against
a
larger
French
army
in
the
Hundred
Years'
War
A
dispute
over
the
succession
to
Edward
led
to
the
Norman
conquest
of
England
in
accomplished
by
an
army
led
by
Duke
William
of
Normandy
The
Normans
themselves
originated
from
Scandinavia
and
had
settled
in
Normandy
in
the
late
th
and
early
th
centuries
This
conquest
led
to
the
almost
total
dispossession
of
the
English
elite
and
its
replacement
by
a
new
French
speaking
aristocracy
whose
speech
had
a
profound
and
permanent
effect
on
the
English
language
Subsequently
the
House
of
Plantagenet
from
Anjou
inherited
the
English
throne
under
Henry
II
adding
England
to

ill
suited
to
the
task
during
an

when
members
of
the
deposed
House
of
Wessex
especially
Edgar
the
Ætheling
and
his
nephews
of
the
Scottish
House
of
Dunkeld

Also

–
a

of

of
Britain
the
relationship
between
the
Saxons
and
the
Celts
and
a
way
of
exorcising
ghosts
and
healing

The
religious
settlement
that
eventually
emerged
in
the
reign
of
Elizabeth
gave
the
Church
of
England
the
distinctive
identity
that
it
has
retained
to
this
day
It
resulted
in
a
Church
that
consciously
retained
a
large
amount
of
continuity
with
the
Church
of
the
Patristic
and
Medieval
periods
in
terms
of
its
use
of
the
catholic
creeds
its
pattern
of
ministry
its
buildings
and
aspects
of
its
liturgy
but
which
also
embodied
Protestant
insights
in
its
theology
and
in
the
overall
shape
of
its
liturgical
practice
The
way
that
this
is
often
expressed
is
by
saying
that
the
Church
of
England
is
both
'catholic
and
reformed'
